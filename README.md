## Project Description

The game frogger, grass on top and bottom of screen, road with lanes in the middle. Frog tries to hop from one end of screen to the other (bottom to top), if frog gets to top, win, level up

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.

#### MVP 

 -Collision between Frog and Car 5 hrs

-Displaying grass outside of window view with continual level increase 5 hrs

-Frog and car movement 4 hrs

-Changing and displaying score 3 hrs



#### PostMVP 

-Car-speed change with level increase 3 hrs
-Potholes in road 3 hrs
-graphics and animations 3 hrs



Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.


| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Collision between Frog and Car| H | 5hrs|  hrs |  hrs |
| -Displaying grass outside of window view with continual level increase | H | 5hrs|  hrs |  hrs |
| -Frog and car movement| H | 4hrs| hrs | hrs |
| -Changing and displaying score| H | 3hrs| hrs | hrs |
